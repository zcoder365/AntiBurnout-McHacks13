# McBurn: Early Burnout Detection System

A Flask-based web application designed to detect and prevent student burnout before it becomes critical. McBurn combines machine learning, lifestyle tracking, and AI-powered feedback to help McGill students maintain their wellbeing and academic success.

## 🎯 Project Overview

McBurn is an intelligent wellness platform that monitors key indicators of burnout (sleep, mood, physical activity, hydration, caffeine intake, and meal patterns) and provides personalized, actionable feedback. Using a predictive burnout scoring model, the app alerts users when their burnout risk increases and suggests campus-specific wellness resources.

**Key Feature:** AI-powered feedback system that uses the Groq API to generate personalized, supportive guidance based on user data and calculated burnout risk.

## ✨ Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in with password hashing
- **Wellness Tracking**: Log daily habits including sleep, mood, hydration, caffeine intake, and meals
- **Burnout Risk Assessment**: Real-time burnout score calculation based on lifestyle factors
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: Personalized suggestions generated by AI that accounts for individual patterns
- **McGill Campus Resources**: Integration of campus-specific wellness resources (Wellness Hub, Recreation, Peer Support)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling to maintain user data across interactions
- **User Profiles**: Track personal wellness data and history

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3 with Flask framework
- **Frontend**: HTML5 & CSS3 for responsive web design
- **Database**: SQLite for lightweight, file-based data persistence
- **Authentication**: Werkzeug security utilities for password hashing
- **Session Management**: Flask-Session for server-side session handling
- **AI/ML**: Groq API for intelligent feedback generation
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv for configuration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Groq API key (for AI feedback generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zcoder365/McBurn-McHacks13.git
   cd McBurn-McHacks13
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Key dependencies:
   - Flask
   - Flask-Session
   - Werkzeug
   - python-dotenv
   - groq

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "from model.database import init_db; init_db.setup()"
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
   
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5002`

## 📖 Usage

### For Users

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account with your email and password
2. **Log In**: Access the dashboard with your credentials
3. **Track Wellness**: Navigate to the tracking page and log:
   - Hours of sleep
   - Current mood
   - Physical activity status
   - Water intake (cups)
   - Caffeine consumption (cups)
   - Number of meals eaten
4. **View Burnout Score**: Receive an immediate burnout risk percentage
5. **Read Feedback**: Get personalized AI-generated suggestions
6. **Access Resources**: View McGill campus wellness resources
7. **Track Progress**: Monitor your burnout trends over time

### For Developers

**Key Functions:**

- `model.verify_user(email, password)` - Authenticates user credentials
- `db.add_user(email, password)` - Creates new user account
- `bs.calculate_burnout()` - Computes burnout risk score
- `fb.build_prompt()` - Constructs AI prompt for feedback
- `feedback_service.generate_feedback()` - Calls Groq API for personalized suggestions

## 🧠 How Burnout Detection Works

1. **Data Collection**: User inputs lifestyle metrics through the tracking form
2. **Burnout Calculation**: The burnout scoring algorithm evaluates:
   - Sleep quality and duration (7+ hours recommended)
   - Mood indicators (motivated/energetic is positive)
   - Physical activity levels
   - Hydration status (7+ cups recommended)
   - Caffeine consumption (1-2 cups recommended)
   - Meal frequency and regularity
3. **Risk Assessment**: A burnout percentage is calculated (0-100%)
4. **AI Feedback**: The Groq API receives this data and generates personalized suggestions
5. **Resource Integration**: Campus-specific resources are recommended based on burnout level
